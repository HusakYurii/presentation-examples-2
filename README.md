## About:
All examples are intended to be shown along with the presentation for visual comprehension.
This time I will talk about:
* What is a vector
* Mathematical operations on vectors
* Velocity
* Acceleration
* etc...

### Table of content
#### Basic operations with vectors:
- [ ] Basic **Vector2D class**
- [ ] Creating objects with **velocity**. Movement of these objects (with illustrative examples)
- [ ] TBD...
#### Advanced operations with vectors:
- [ ] Creating objects with **velocity and acceleration**. Movement of these objects (with illustrative examples)
- [ ] A stone is thrown at an angle Î¸ to the horizon (velocity and acceleration are taken into account). 
- [ ] TBD...
