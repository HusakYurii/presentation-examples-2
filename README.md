To navigate through examples use [Root file](https://husakyurii.github.io/presentation-examples-2/.)
## About:
All examples are intended to be shown along with the presentation for visual comprehension.
This time I will talk about:
* What is a vector
* Mathematical operations on vectors
* Velocity
* Acceleration
* etc...

### Table of content
#### Basic operations with vectors:
- [ ] What is a Vector (explanation) - _has not been added to presentation yet_
- [ ] Basic operations with vectors (explanation) - _has not been added to presentation yet_
- [x] Basic **Vector2D class** (we can look at the library)
- [ ] Basic Newton's laws (1st, 2nd, 3rd), gravitational attraction law - _has not been added to presentation yet_
- [x] Creating objects with **velocity** and/or **acceleration**. Movement of these objects (with illustrative examples)
- [x] Simulating of a **Steering** force (with illustrative examples)
- [x] Simulation of **Gravitational attraction** (with illustrative examples)
#### Advanced operations with vectors:
- [ ] A stone is thrown at an angle Î¸ to the horizon (velocity and acceleration are taken into account).
